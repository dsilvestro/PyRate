    "Conclusion:\n",
    "PyRate uses a Bayesian framework to infer speciation and extinction rates from fossil data. It incorporates both preservation processes (modeled as Poisson processes) and diversification processes (modeled as birth-death Markov processes). The analysis begins with a maximum likelihood test to select the best preservation model, followed by MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. Throughout the analysis, priors remain fixed, and the posterior is calculated as the product of the prior and likelihood. This approach allows for robust estimation of diversification rates while accounting for the complexities and uncertainties in the fossil record."

    "\n",
    "1. Download fossil occurrences for a clade from the Paleobiology Database.\n",
    "   - Search for the genus Canis and save it as Canis_pbdb_data.csv\n",
    "   - Check \"Show accepted names only\" and uncheck \"Include metadata at the beginning of the output\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Launch R by opening a Terminal window and typing `R`, or use the R GUI app or RStudio.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Load the pyrate_utilities.r file in R:\n",
    "   ```R\n",
    "   # Load the pyrate_utilities.r file to access utility functions for PyRate\n",
    "   # This file contains functions to parse and process the input data for PyRate\n",
    "   source(\"../PyRate-master/pyrate_utilities.r\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check which species are extant today and define a vector of extant species:\n",
    "   ```R\n",
    "   # Define a vector of extant Canis species\n",
    "   # This information is used to correctly assign the status of each species (extinct or extant)\n",
    "   extant_dogs = c(\"Canis rufus\",\"Canis lupus\",\"Canis aureus\",\"Canis latrans\",\"Canis mesomelas\",\"Canis anthus\",\"Pseudalopex gymnocercus\",\"Canis adustus\",\"Canis familiaris\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Parse the raw data and generate PyRate input file:\n",
    "   ```R\n",
    "   # Extract fossil occurrence data from PBDB raw table and save it in a PyRate-compatible input file\n",
    "   # The extract.ages.pbdb function from pyrate_utilities.r is used to process the data\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "   This function does not check for synonyms or typos. The `replicates` option (default 1) resamples the ages of each fossil occurrence from the respective temporal range. The `cutoff` option removes occurrences with an age range greater than the specified value.\n",

    "   cd \"../PyRate-master\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Launch PyRate with the following arguments to get summary statistics\n",

    "   This command checks the generated input files and provides summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate PyRate input file (option 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare a fossil occurrence table with 4 columns: Taxon name, Status (extinct or extant), Minimum age, and Maximum age. An additional column can be included for a trait value (e.g., body mass).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Launch R as explained above.\n",
    "\n",

    "   extract.ages(file=\"../PyRate/example_files/Ursidae.txt\", replicates=10)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This function includes `replicates` and `cutoff` options similar to `extract.ages.pbdb()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accounting for age dependence in multiple occurrences from the same site\n",
    "If a fossil assemblage or site contains several occurrences, they should be considered as coeval when randomizing their age within the temporal range. This can be done by specifying a \"Site\" column in the input data with a number indicating the assemblage ID for each occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "*pyrate_utilities.r* (`extract.ages()`) will automatically resample fossil ages by site when a \"Site\" column is included in the input table.\n",

    "# Check species names for typos and inconsistent spelling\n",
    "\n",
    "PyRate implements an algorithm to check for inconsistent spelling in species names (format: *Genus\\_species*) using the `-check_names` function. It requires a text file with one species name per row, such as the \\*\\_SpeciesList.txt file generated while preparing PyRate's input files.\n",

    "Run the following command in the Terminal:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Check for inconsistent spelling in species names\n",
    "# The -check_names flag is used to specify the input file with species names\n",
    "python PyRate.py -check_names PBDB_dataset_TaxonList.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This returns a table saved in a text file with plausible typos. Ranks 0 and 1 indicate the most likely cases of misspellings, whereas ranks 2 and 3 are most likely truly different names. Note that this algorithm does not check for synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher should double-check these possible inconsistencies and fix the names in their dataset accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Estimation of speciation and extinction rates through time\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining the preservation model\n",
    "PyRate supports different preservation models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-homogeneous Poisson process of preservation (NHPP)**: Default model, preservation rates change during the lifespan of each lineage following a bell-shaped distribution.\n",
    "   - The `NHPP_lik` function in PyRate.py calculates the likelihood of the NHPP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Homogeneous Poisson process (HPP)**: Preservation rate is constant through time.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Run PyRate with HPP model\n",
    "   # The -mHPP flag is used to specify the HPP model\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -mHPP\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The `HOMPP_lik` function in PyRate.py calculates the likelihood of the HPP model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Time-variable Poisson process (TPP)**: Preservation rates are constant within predefined time frames but can vary across time frames (e.g., geological epochs).\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Run PyRate with TPP model and provide a file with times delimiting the epochs\n",
    "   # The -qShift flag is used to specify the file with the times of rate shifts\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -qShift epochs_q.txt\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   The default prior on the vector of preservation rates is a single gamma distribution with shape = 1.5 and rate = 1.5. These values can be changed using the `-pP` command, e.g., `-pP 2 0.1`.\n",
    "   The rate parameter of the prior can be estimated from the data by setting it to 0:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Run PyRate with TPP model and estimate the rate parameter of the prior\n",
    "   # The -pP flag is used to specify the prior parameters\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -qShift epochs_q.txt -pP 1.5 0\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This approach is recommended when multiple preservation rates are estimated.\n",
    "   - The `TPP_model` variable in PyRate.py indicates whether the TPP model is being used.\n",
    "   - The `NHPP_lik` function in PyRate.py calculates the likelihood of the TPP model by integrating over the different time frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Gamma model of rate heterogeneity**: Can be coupled with NHPP, HPP, and TPP models to account for heterogeneity in the preservation rate across lineages.\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Run PyRate with NHPP model and Gamma rate heterogeneity\n",
    "   # The -mG flag is used to specify the Gamma model\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -mG\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Run PyRate with HPP model and Gamma rate heterogeneity\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -mHPP -mG\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Run PyRate with TPP model and Gamma rate heterogeneity\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -qShift epochs_q.txt -mG\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   When combining a TPP model with a Gamma model, you can log the estimated relative preservation rate for each lineage using the `-log_sp_q_rates` flag:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   # Run PyRate with TPP model, Gamma rate heterogeneity, and log per-lineage relative preservation rates\n",
    "   # The -log_sp_q_rates flag is used to log the relative preservation rates\n",
    "   python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -qShift epochs_q.txt -mG -log_sp_q_rates\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   This will save an additional log file with the estimated relative preservation rate for each lineage.\n",
    "   - The `argsG` variable in PyRate.py indicates whether the Gamma model is being used.\n",
    "   - The `get_gamma_rates` function in PyRate.py calculates the Gamma-distributed rate heterogeneity across lineages.\n",
    "   - The `NHPP_lik`, `HOMPP_lik`, and `TPP_model` functions in PyRate.py incorporate the Gamma rate heterogeneity when calculating the likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model testing across preservation models\n",
    "A maximum likelihood test is available to assess which of NHPP, HPP, or TPP is best supported by the data. Run the test using the `-PPmodeltest` flag:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run the preservation model test\n",
    "# The -PPmodeltest flag is used to run the model test\n",
    "python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -qShift epochs_q.txt -PPmodeltest\n",
    "```\n",
    "The Gamma model is not tested here, but it is recommended to add it to the best model among NHPP, HPP, or TPP as selected by the model testing.\n",
    "- The `PPmodeltest` function in the `pyrate_lib.PPmodeltest` module performs the model testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis setup\n",
    "The main settings for a standard PyRate analysis are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Estimate origination and extinction times of each lineage\n",
    "2. Estimate preservation rate and its level of heterogeneity\n",
    "3. Estimate speciation and extinction rates through time\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal rate variation is introduced by rate shifts. The number and temporal placement of shifts are estimated from the data using the RJMCMC algorithm (default) or the BDMCMC algorithm.\n",

    "- The `MCMC` function in PyRate.py runs the MCMC analysis based on the specified settings.\n",
    "- The `BDMCMC` function implements the BDMCMC algorithm, while the `RJMCMC` function implements the RJMCMC algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze a specific replicate from the input file, use the `-j` flag followed by the replicate number:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run PyRate analysis with HPP model, Gamma rate heterogeneity, and replicate 1\n",
    "# The -j flag specifies the replicate number\n",
    "python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -A 2 -mHPP -mG -j 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To change the number of MCMC iterations and the sampling frequency, use the `-n` and `-s` flags:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Run PyRate analysis with Gamma rate heterogeneity, 20 million iterations, and sampling every 5000 iterations\n",
    "# The -n flag sets the number of iterations, and the -s flag sets the sampling frequency\n",
    "python PyRate.py Canis_pbdb_data_PyRate.py -mG -n 20000000 -s 5000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output files\n",
    "The PyRate analysis produces three output files in the *pyrate\\_mcmc\\_logs* folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **sum.txt**: Text file with the complete list of settings used in the analysis.\n",
    "2. **mcmc.log**: Tab-separated table with the MCMC samples of the posterior, prior, likelihoods, preservation rate, shape parameter of gamma-distributed heterogeneity, number of sampled rate shifts, time of origin of the oldest lineage, total branch length, and times of speciation and extinction of all taxa.\n",
