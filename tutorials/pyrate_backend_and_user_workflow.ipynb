    "Conclusion:\n",
    "PyRate uses a Bayesian framework to infer speciation and extinction rates from fossil data. It incorporates both preservation processes (modeled as Poisson processes) and diversification processes (modeled as birth-death Markov processes). The analysis begins with a maximum likelihood test to select the best preservation model, followed by MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. Throughout the analysis, priors remain fixed, and the posterior is calculated as the product of the prior and likelihood. This approach allows for robust estimation of diversification rates while accounting for the complexities and uncertainties in the fossil record."

    "\n",
    "This step-by-step guide provides a clear workflow for using PyRate, including the code for each step. The code snippets are based on the PyRate tutorial and are designed to help you accomplish each step in the analysis process. The guide also notes when new files are created, where they are saved, and which files feed into which steps. User input is needed for defining extant species, setting prior distributions, and specifying model parameters.\n",
