    "Conclusion:\n",
    "PyRate uses a Bayesian framework to infer speciation and extinction rates from fossil data. It incorporates both preservation processes (modeled as Poisson processes) and diversification processes (modeled as birth-death Markov processes). The analysis begins with a maximum likelihood test to select the best preservation model, followed by MCMC sampling to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters. Throughout the analysis, priors remain fixed, and the posterior is calculated as the product of the prior and likelihood. This approach allows for robust estimation of diversification rates while accounting for the complexities and uncertainties in the fossil record."
